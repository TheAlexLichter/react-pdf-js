## How To Install

There are only three peer dependencies that our library requires:

We will assume you already have react & react-dom installed and will focus on @mikecousins/react-pdf and pdfjs-dist.

### pnpm

To install using the pnpm package manager:

```bash
pnpm add @mikecousins/react-pdf pdfjs-dist
```

### npm

To install using the npm package manager:

```bash
npm i @mikecousins/react-pdf pdfjs-dist
```

### yarn

```
